# 🤝 Contributing to SDE-Interview-Blueprint

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **SDE-Interview-Blueprint**!  
This project’s goal is to gather and organize **SDE interview preparation resources** (CS fundamentals, coding questions, system design, etc.) in one place, so learners don’t need to search everywhere.  

We welcome contributions of **resources, documentation, examples, coding solutions, and improvements**.  
Whether you’re here to fix typos, add a new resource, or contribute a complete guide—**your efforts matter**.
